# Java-Customer-Integrated-System-1
Hello! This code above is a Java project I created for a class, CSE 2012: Software Design, I was in. This project allows for a user of the program to input data
about someone who is apart of their dealership. It goes and stores this data in a textfile, which can be opened easily again.

The program created allows for a few functions to be called upon in the GUI itself; Creation of a profile, Deletion of a profile, Updating a profile, Finding a specific
profile, and to Find All profiles listed under the creater of them.

The code's GUI uses 3 other classes to run that I have created; CustomerProf which is the basic customer Profile which uses another class I created, VehicleInfo. The 
last class I created was the CustomerProfDB, which is the heavy lifting database which I created in order for each function to actually work. They are all packaged in
order to be used by the GUI, CustomerProfGUI.java, which is the GUI that puts everything together in the program and makes it functional.
